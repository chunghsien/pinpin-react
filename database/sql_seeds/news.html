<h3 class="space-mb--30">Sequins</h3>
<p class="space-mb--30">To say sequins and sparkles will be a big deal next summer is an understatement. In every fashion capital, glitter prevailed, starting with Tom Ford and Marc Jacobs right
  through to Gucci (pictured here), Dior and Chanel. Style yours with a sweatshirt to give them daytime longevity.</p>
<h3 class="space-mb--30">Pastels</h3>
<p class="space-mb--30">Whether lilac, pink, lemon or duck egg blue, expect to see an array of fashion’s prettiest shades next season. But as Victoria Beckham (pictured) said “delicacy can be
  strong”; saccharine these colours are not – consider tailoring in ice cream hues or wearing them in unexpected ways like at Celine.</p>
<h3 class="space-mb--30">Checks</h3>
<p class="space-mb--30">It looks as if heritage checks are going nowhere for the season ahead. Balenciaga’s came via voluminous coats as seen here, while Victoria Beckham’s had a more traditional
  appeal. Anyone looking for floaty feminine styles should turn to Sonia Rykiel where they were bright and summer-ready. Burberry’s homage was perhaps the most overt – expect to see its check caps
  everywhere next season.</p>
<h3 class="space-mb--30">Plastic</h3>
<p class="space-mb--30">Perfect for British summers, waterproof plastics were a predominant look for spring/summer 2020. As seen at Chanel (pictured), Isabel, Marant, Burberry, Topshop, Calvin
  Klein and Fendi, plastic in varying shades will be everywhere in 12 months time.</p>
